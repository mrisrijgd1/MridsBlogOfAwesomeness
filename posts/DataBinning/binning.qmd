Welcome!
In this post, I'm going to talk about what data binning is!
  
### What is Data Binning?
Data binning is a method for organizing quantities of continuous values into fewer "bins." For instance, you could want to divide a group of people's ages into fewer age intervals if you have statistics on them (for example, grouping every five years together).

### Example of Data Binning in R using histograms
#### **Creating Data**
To bin data, we first need to make data. To generate sample data, we can use the `sample` function.
```{r}
set.seed(123)
x <- sample(x=1:10, replace=TRUE, size=10)
x
```
The `set.seed` function makes it so that every time we run the command with a certain number, we will get the same result instead of it being random. If you want to know more about the `sample` function and its parameters then run `?sample`. I created a sample data that is 10 numbers long with the possible numbers being 1-10 and assigned it to the variable x.

#### **Histograms**
Histograms are a type of diagram. Using the `hist` function we can can create a histogram.
```{r}
hist(x, breaks=3)
```
Here, I created a histogram of the variable x with 3 numbers grouped together, i.e. 2, 3, 4; 4, 5, 6; 6, 7, 8 and 8, 9, 10. (Thats what the breaks parameter did).  
  
**That was all! I hope it helped and *stay tuned for more...***
