### More about them
The Art of Living courses inspires a service ethic. They believe that adding an element of service adds depths to our lives. They also work with several communities such as **Disaster & Trauma Relief**.

### Personal Experience
I regularly practice the YES Sudarshan Kriya, which is a teenager version of the the normal Sudarshan Kriya, and I've found that practicing their breathing techniques has improved my mental focus and greatly enhanced my memory. I find these techniques very calming as well.
