Welcome!
In this post I'm going to talk about training data sets.

### What are training data sets?
A training data set is a data set of examples used during the learning process and is used to fit the parameters (e.g., weights) of, for example, a classifier.

### What are they used for?
For classification tasks, a supervised learning algorithm looks at the training data set to determine, or learn, the optimal combinations of variables that will generate a good predictive model, The goal is to produce a trained (fitted) model that generalizes well to new, unknown data.

### Validation and Testing
The predictive model is put through a validation test to check its accuracy using a validation data set and tweaked if necessary. Then the best model is chosen and used on a test data as a final accuracy test.
