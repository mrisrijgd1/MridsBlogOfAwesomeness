To generate sample data, we can use the `sample` function.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nset.seed(123)\nx <- sample(x=1:10, replace=TRUE, size=10)\nx\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1]  3  3 10  2  6  5  4  6  9 10\n```\n:::\n:::\n\nThe `set.seed` function makes it so that every time we run the command with a certain number, we will get the same result instead of it being random. If you want to know more about the `sample` function and its parameters then run `?sample`. I created a sample data that is 10 numbers long with the possible numbers being 1-10 and assigned it to the variable x.\n\n#### **Histograms**\nHistograms are a type of diagram. Using the `hist` function we can can create a histogram.\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhist(x, breaks=3)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\nHere, I created a histogram of the variable x with 3 numbers grouped together, i.e. 2, 3, 4; 4, 5, 6; 6, 7, 8 and 8, 9, 10. (Thats what the breaks parameter did).  \n  \n**That was all! I hope it helped and *stay tuned for more...***\n",
